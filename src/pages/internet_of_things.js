    <h1>What Is IoT?</h1>
    <p>This course will start by providing a definition of the term. We will talk about how various trends have enabled the Internet of Things, and how it changes the way programming is done. We will also discuss some of the ramifications that IoT is having on society today.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child}>
    <h1>Hardware and Software for IoT</h1>
    <p>IoT devices are implemented using both hardware and software components. Dedicated hardware components are used to implement the interface with the physical world, and to perform tasks which are more computationally complex. Microcontrollers are used to execute software that interprets inputs and controls the system. This module discusses the roles of both the hardware and software components in the system.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child}>
    <h1>Edge and Cloud Computing for IoT</h1>
    <p>In IoT architecture, edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm which brings computer data storage closer to the location where it is needed. Computation is largely or completely performed on distributed device nodes. Edge computing pushes applications, data and computing power (services) away from centralized cloud points to locations closer to the user. Edge computing does not need contact with any centralized cloud, although in IoT archetectures it interacts with one.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child5}>
    <h1>Fundamentals of Rust Programming</h1>
    <p>This module explores key Rust concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. This Rust programming language introduction will also show you how to: - Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - Use Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code, including downloading and building dependencies - Effectively use Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and employ your own You’ll learn to develop reliable code that’s speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child}>
    <h1>Introduction to Linux and Bas</h1>
    <p>Linux containers are poised to take over the world; we will start this module with an introduction of Linux and the command line. For many non-technical people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of mystery. However, you only have to know a handful of basic commands to start feeling comfortable. In this module we will cover the basic commands to get you started.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child5}>
    <h1>Fundamentals of Kubernetes for Edge and Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>The Kubernetes container orchestration system safely manages the structure and flow of a distributed application, organizing containers and services for maximum efficiency. Kubernetes serves as an operating system for your clusters, eliminating the need to factor the underlying network and server infrastructure into your designs. In this quarter we will teach you to use Kubernetes to deploy container-based distributed IoTapplications.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child}>
    <h1>Fundamentals of KubeEdge</h1>
    <p>The key goal for KubeEdge is extending Kubernetes ecosystem from cloud to edge. KubeEdge provides a containerized edge computing platform, which is inherently scalable. The rise of AI makes edge computing more important. Complex models trained in the cloud are deployed at the edge for inferencing. In this module we will go through the fundaments of KubeEdge technology.</p>
    </div>
    <div className= {IOT.child5}>
    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Internet of Things (IoT)</h1>
    <p>Before implementing deep-learning algorithms in this quarter, we will first familiarize ourselves with mathematical blocks of neural networks theory. We going to start by getting our hands dirty writing some simple TensorFlow 2.0 code in Rust. And then move on to advanced deep learning concepts applicable to IoT projects. This module will also cover some essential advantages of TensorFlow 2.0 to convince you it’s the deep-learning library of choice.</p>
